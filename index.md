I am currently a third-year Human Genetics Graduate Student in Dan Arking's lab at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  My work focuses on understanding how mitochondrial DNA copy number and heteroplasmy can affect biological pathways.  Always interested in learning more about statistical and computational methods!
