**2016-Present**
<br>
PhD. Candidate, Arking lab   
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD  
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine  
<br>
My work in the Arking lab focuses on using statistical models to understand the relationships between mitochondrial DNA copy number and nuclear gene expression.  I also work on elucidating the relationships between mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy and aging-related diseases.

<br>
Compared normalization methods for RNA-sequencing using publicly available data from recount2.  
<br>
*Rotation student, Goff lab*
<br>
Analyzed a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset using Monocle with the goal of understanding cortical development in mice and built shiny apps to allow for easy data visualization for a collaborator.

*Rotation student, Arking lab*
<br>
Used plink to perform quality control on 1000 genomes data, extracted SNPs that separated certain ethnic populations, and evaluated dimensionality reduction methods.
