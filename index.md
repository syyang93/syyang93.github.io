I am currently a Computational Genomics Research Scientist at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, where I work in a collaborative team that applies computational methodologies for therapeutic drug discovery.  

I completed a PhD in Human Genetics in Dan Arking's lab at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  My PhD work focused on understanding how mitochondrial DNA copy number and heteroplasmy can affect biological pathways.  Always interested in learning more about coding and genetics!
